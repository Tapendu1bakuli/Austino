      "1) Prepare today for a critical incident by having it clear in your head what you have a duty to report and what you have a right to withhold until consulting with an attorney.\n \n 2) Never give information as exact if you are not sure. When describing number of shots, locations of impact weapon strikes, locations of suspects, etc., always make it clear that this is an approximate guess. Do not get locked into something definite unless you are absolutely sure. Even if you are sure, give yourself room for error. You just survived a deadly encounter and your brain is not functioning at normal levels.\n \n 3) Never get sucked into agreeing with a question. example So you were about four feet from the suspect? be careful of these. See rule number 2 above. Put answers in your words, not theirs.\n \n4) Look out for your fellow officer. If your partner on call has just been involved in a critical incident, try to remind them to take a breath, reflect on what happened and to only give necessary information until the attorney arrives. Most cops want to talk to everyone that will listen about the details immediately preceding an incident. It is a natural human response, but it must be controlled and you can do your partner a huge favor by helping with that control. \n\n5) Make sure that there is an understanding among all those that you work with that someone will call the APA and an attorney if you are ever involved in a critical incident. Plan now, because at the time, these things won't happen.";
